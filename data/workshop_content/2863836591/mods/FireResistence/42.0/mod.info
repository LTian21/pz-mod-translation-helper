description=This mod reduces the damage inflicted by fire, we have always thought that fire  does too much damage and too fast. With this mod the fire has a more realistic damage: if it is touched for a moment you will not catch fire and there will be no burns but only minimal damage. To burn yourself you need to stop for a few moments in the fiery tile. This mod also affects the fire generated by bombs, however the blast damage will remain unchanged. The mod also includes sandbox options to customize the fire damage to your liking, but I recommend leaving them as they are by default if you want to make the fire realistic.
